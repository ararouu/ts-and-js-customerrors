# ts-and-js-customerrors
Some quick and easy to make code to make custom errors for TypeScript and JavaScript.

This code is free to use as it is extremely easy to make, *obviously.*

This repository features ECMAScript Modules (ESM) JavaScript and TypeScript versions. This does not support CommonJS (CJS), as it is outdated.

*I wish the JavaScript folder wasn't on top of the TypeScript folder as TS is superior compared to JS. :troll:*
